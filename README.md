# Hello Team1! 

## Welcome to your GitHub Page for [DSMHack.Design](http://dsmhack.design)! 
- This page is using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- It currently lives in GitHub [here](https://github.com/DavidHansen-0x454d43/2019-ghp-team-01).

## What's this now?

My motivation for creating these pages is give a other [DSMHack](http://dsmhack.org) 2019 teams insight into your design during the hackathon. (i.e. what challenge your are trying to solve, what technologies you're using, what kind of help you need) 

After the hackathon, you can edit this page to highlight your team and what you accomplished for your nonprofit.
